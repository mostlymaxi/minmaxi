# MIN MAXI 00
find a pythagorean triplet (a, b, c) that solves
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
where a, b, and c are integers (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...)

for example:
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2

the winner is the one that has the largest product of a, b, and c:
a x b x c

please give me your answer in base 10 (scientific notation is okay)
